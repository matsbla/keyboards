The different local languages in Togo uses all together 17 symbols not found in French language: Ʒ, Ɛ, Ɗ, Ƴ, Ʊ, Ɩ, Ɔ, Ǝ, Ɖ, Ƒ, Ɣ, Ĥ, Ɲ, Ʋ, Ɓ, Ŋ, Ɨ. Togolese local languages use 9 tone markers: Acute ( ´ ), Grave ( ` ), Circumflex ( ˆ ), Caron ( ˇ ), Macron ( ¯ ), Tilde ( ~ ), Tilde + Acute (  ̃́ ), Tilde + Grave (  ̃̀ ), Diaeresis ( ¨ ). The vowels can use these tone markers except diaeresis. Y is not used as a vowel in most local languages, and can only use diaeresis. The nasal consonants m, n, ŋ can only have have accent tones (acute and grave).
